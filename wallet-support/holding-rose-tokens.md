## Self Custody with Ledger

## Staking and Delegating on the Oasis Network

Staking and Delegation on the Oasis Network is a wonderful way to hold your ROSE tokens. A few key resources to get started!

The Oasis Network is supported by an amazing community of validators and infrastructure providers. Many provide services to help you set up your own validator node and/or make delegation easy.

In addition, Ledger GUI support for delegating is coming soon!
