# Holding ROSE Tokens

_Last updated as of October 9, 2020_

{% hint style="info" %}
The purpose of this documentation is to provide instructions and support for ROSE token holders who will receive tokens at the time of Mainnet launch. Below are a number of ways to hold tokens -- both via custody providers and self custody -- and an easy to use guide to delegating your tokens to top validators on the network.
{% endhint %}

## Custody Providers

At the time of Mainnet Launch using a custody provider will be the easiest way to store and hold your ROSE tokens. These custody providers are industry-leaders who each support a number of top crypto assets. Below are some simple ways to get in touch, but please do reach out to them directly for more information on insurance, fees and cross-chain support.

## Self Custody

### [Ledger Hardware Wallet](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) \(Available on Ledger Live\)

We recommend this option for teams with Ledger Wallet experience, and more specifically Ledger experimental / developer mode

* **Setup:** Read more about Ledger setup on the Oasis Network [here](https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-core-ledger/)
* **Sharing your wallet address for distribution:** Once you complete the setup on Ledger, please submit your wallet address [here](https://oasisfoundation.typeform.com/to/Cyk8NAzc)

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Ledger is currently only available via Linux and CLI. We do have a few easy to use GUIs in development._ 
{% endhint %}

### _Coming Soon_: Ledger GUIs in Development

We understand that the Ledger Wallet could use a better UI. A few solutions in process.

#### [Anthem](https://anthem.chorus.one/)

* A tool built by Chorus One that makes address signing, staking, delegation, and transfers easy to do. Integrated with Ledger hardware.
* Oasis address creation is currently supported by Anthem
* Available in late October

## _Coming Soon:_ Web Wallet Support

In addition to the GUI listed above there are also a number of other web wallets in development including an integration for BitPie and Trustwallet. More to come here soon.

## Staking and Delegating on the Oasis Network

Staking and Delegation on the Oasis Network is a wonderful way to hold your ROSE tokens. A few key resources to get started!

### Rewards and Tokenonomics

Mining rewards vary over the course of the Network. In the first four years rewards will range between 15-2% over time. More [here](https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-network-primer/token-metrics-and-distribution#staking-incentives).

### How to Stake and Delegate

The Oasis Network is supported by an amazing community of validators and infrastructure providers. Many provide services to help you set up your own validator node and/or make delegation easy.

#### Oasis Validators and Infrastructure Providers

A summary of validators interested in delegations or providing infrastructure support to token holders is [here](https://airtable.com/shrPKNSKjc8rkAhEn) \(including contact info and a bit more detail about the team and project\). Please feel free to reach out to the teams directly for more information on staking and delegation logistics, fees and more.

{% hint style="info" %}
The validator registry is in alphabetical order and includes information provided by each validator. To check performance, commission rates and more about each validator please visit one of our many [blockexplorers](www.oasisscan.com) and [leaderboards](https://hubble.figment.io/oasis/chains/mainnet-beta). For those that have not listed a name you can cross-reference their entity ID in the table below with either website to validate performance on the network.
