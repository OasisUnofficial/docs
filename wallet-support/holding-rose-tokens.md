# Holding ROSE Tokens

_Last updated as of October 9, 2020_

{% hint style="info" %}
The purpose of this documentation is to provide instructions and support for ROSE token holders who will receive tokens at the time of Mainnet launch. Below are a number of ways to hold tokens -- both via custody providers and self custody -- and an easy to use guide to delegating your tokens to top validators on the network.
{% endhint %}

## Custody Providers

At the time of Mainnet Launch using a custody provider will be the easiest way to store and hold your ROSE tokens. These custody providers are industry-leaders who each support a number of top crypto assets. Below are some simple ways to get in touch, but please do reach out to them directly for more information on insurance, fees and cross-chain support.

## Self Custody with Ledger

Oasis currently has a Ledger Hardware Wallet available on [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live). 

### Set up

To set up your Ledger Device take the following steps:

* Go to [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) and enable experimental mode.
* Download the Oasis Wallet app on Ledger Live.
* Once you download the app you can set up your address, delegate, and make transactions in two ways -- via the Oasis CLI or one of the many Oasis Ledger GUIs.

### Using the Oasis CLI

The Oasis CLI supports both Linux and MacOs. To use the Ledger app using the Oasis CLI go [here](https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-core-ledger/usage/setup).

### Using a Ledger GUI

To easily see your wallet address, make transfers, and delegate you can use an Oasis Ledger GUI. Two initial options below.

#### [RockX Wallet](https://oasis-wallet.rockx.com/)

* Currently supports address signing and transfers for the Oasis Network
* Note that transfers on Mainnet Beta are disabled; to test wallet transfers please select "Testnet".
* Staking and delegation in development

#### [Anthem by Chorus One](https://anthem.chorus.one/)

* Currently supports address signing for the Oasis Network
* _Staking, Delegation and Transfers in development_

### Verifying your wallet address

If you'd like to verify your wallet address before the Oasis Mainnet launches, we can send you a transaction on the Oasis Testnet. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the wallet address for the Oasis Testnet and Mainnet will be the same. 
{% endhint %}

Please take the following steps:

1. Share your wallet address with us on [slack](www.oasisprotocol.org/slack) in the \#testnet channel. When you ask for tokens please indicate that this is to test your Ledger Wallet.
2. Oasis will send you 3.14 TEST tokens.
3. Send 1.00 TEST tokens back.

### Share your wallet address for distribution

Once you complete the setup on Ledger, please submit your wallet address [here](https://oasisfoundation.typeform.com/to/Cyk8NAzc).

{% hint style="info" %}
_**COMING SOON**_  
In addition to the GUIs listed above there are also a number of other wallets in development including an integration for [BitPie](www.bitpie.com) in late October and [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/). 
{% endhint %}

## Staking and Delegating on the Oasis Network

Staking and Delegation on the Oasis Network is a wonderful way to hold your ROSE tokens. A few key resources to get started!

### Rewards and Tokenonomics

Mining rewards vary over the course of the Network. In the first four years rewards will range between 15-2% over time. More [here](https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-network-primer/token-metrics-and-distribution#staking-incentives).

### How to Stake and Delegate

The Oasis Network is supported by an amazing community of validators and infrastructure providers. Many provide services to help you set up your own validator node and/or make delegation easy.

In addition, Ledger GUI support for delegating is coming soon!

#### Oasis Validators and Infrastructure Providers

A summary of validators interested in delegations or providing infrastructure support to token holders is [here](https://airtable.com/shrPKNSKjc8rkAhEn) \(including contact info and a bit more detail about the team and project\). Please feel free to reach out to the teams directly for more information on staking and delegation logistics, fees and more.

{% hint style="info" %}
The validator registry is in alphabetical order and includes information provided by each validator. To check performance, commission rates and more about each validator please visit one of our many [blockexplorers](www.oasisscan.com) and [leaderboards](https://hubble.figment.io/oasis/chains/mainnet-beta). For those that have not listed a name you can cross-reference their entity ID in the table below with either website to validate performance on the network.
