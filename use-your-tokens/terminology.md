# Terminology

### Delegation

You can **delegate** your tokens by submitting an **escrow** transaction that deposits a specific number of tokens into someone elseâ€™s escrow account \(as opposed to **staking** tokens, which usually refers to depositing tokens into your own escrow account\).

In other words, delegating your tokens is equivalent to staking your tokens in someone else's validator node. Delegating your tokens can give you the opportunity to participate in the Oasis Network's proof-of-stake consensus system and earn rewards via someone else's validator node.

### Escrow

### Staking

You can stake your tokens by submitting an **escrow** transaction that deposits a specific number of tokens into your escrow account.

### Rewards

By delegating your tokens to someone else's node, you can earn a portion of the rewards earned by that node through its participation in the Oasis Network.

### Slashing

Your delegated tokens can be slashed if the node that you delegated your tokens to gets slashed for double signing.
