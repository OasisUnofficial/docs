# Hardware

{% hint style="info" %}
The hardware requirements listed on this page are the suggested minimum requirements. It might be possible to configure a system with less resources, but you run the risk of being underprovisioned and thereby prone to loss of stake.

## Minimum Requirements <a id="suggested-minimum-configurations"></a>

As noted in the [Architecture Overview](../../oasis-network/network-architecture-overview.md), the Oasis Network is composed of multiple classes of Nodes that participate in different committees. The majority of committees have common system configurations for the participant Nodes.

We suggest your system meets the following minimum system requirements to run an Oasis node:

* 2.0 GHz x86-64 CPU

{% hint style="warning" %}
The CPU must have [AES-NI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set) support.
{% endhint %}

* 2 GB ECC RAM
* 500 GB High Speed Storage
