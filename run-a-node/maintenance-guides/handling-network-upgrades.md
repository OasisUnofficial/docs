# Handling Network Upgrades

{% hint style="warning" %}
Following this guide when there is no network upgrade will result in you losing your place on the current network.
{% endhint %}

The following guide should be used when the network has agreed to do a software upgrade.

## Dump Network State

{% hint style="info" %}
Do not stop your [Oasis Node](../prerequisites/oasis-node.md) process just yet.
{% endhint %}

Before an upgrade we will update the [Upgrade Log](../upgrade-log.md) to specify the block height at which to dump.

To dump the state of the network to a genesis file, run:

```bash
oasis-node genesis dump \
  -a unix:/serverdir/node/internal.sock \
  --genesis.file /serverdir/etc/genesis_dump.json \
  --height <HEIGHT-TO-DUMP>
```

replacing `<HEIGHT-TO-DUMP>` with the block height we specified.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can only run the following command _after_ the `<HEIGHT-TO-DUMP>` block height has been reached on the network.

To see the network's current height, run:

```bash
oasis-node control status -a unix:/serverdir/node/internal.sock
```

and observe the value of the `consensus.latest_height` key.
{% endhint %}

## Patch Dumped State

{% hint style="info" %}
At the moment, we don't provide state patches.
{% endhint %}

## Download and Verify the Provided Genesis File

Download the new genesis file linked in the [Network Parameters](../../oasis-network/network-parameters.md) and save it as `/serverdir/etc/genesis.json`.

Then compare the dumped state with the downloaded genesis file:

```bash
diff --unified=3 genesis_dump.json genesis.json
```

### Example diff for Mainnet Beta to Mainnet network upgrade

Let's assume that the above `diff` command returns:

We can observe that the provided genesis file mostly updates some particular network parameters. In addition, some ROSE tokens were transferred from an account to the Common Pool. All other things remained unchanged.

Let's break down the diff and explain what has changed.

The following genesis file fields will always change on a network upgrade:

* `chain_id`: A unique ID of the network.
* `genesis_time`: Time from which the genesis file is valid.
* `halt_epoch`: The epoch when the node will stop functioning. We set this to intentionally force an upgrade.

The following fields were a particular change in this upgrade:

* `staking.params.reward_schedule`: This field describes the staking reward model. It was changed to start at 20% \(annualized\) and range from 20% to 2% over the first 4 years of the network. For more details, see the updated [Token Metrics and Distribution](https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-network-primer/token-metrics-and-distribution) doc.
* `staking.params.disable_transfers`: This field was removed to enable token transfers.
* `staking.common_pool`: This field represents the Common Pool. Its balance was increased by 450M ROSE to fund increased staking rewards.
* `staking.ledger.oasis1qrad7s7nqm4gvyzr8yt2rdk0ref489rn3vn400d6`: This field corresponds to the Community and Ecosystem Wallet. Its `general.balance` was reduced by 450M ROSE and transferred to the Common Pool to fund increased staking rewards.
* `extra_data`: This field can hold network's extra data, but is currently ignored everywhere. For this upgrade, we changed it back to the value in the Mainnet Beta genesis file to include the Oasis network's genesis quote: _”_[_Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes%3F)_” \[submitted by Oasis Community Member Daniyar Borangaziyev\]._

{% hint style="info" %}
The balances in the genesis file are enumerated in nROSE, with 1 billion nROSE being equivalent to 1 ROSE token. For more details, see the [Genesis File Overview](../../oasis-network/genesis-file.md).
{% endhint %}

If you obtain the same result, then you have successfully verified the provided genesis file.

## Stop Your Node

This will depend on your process manager. You should stop your [Oasis Node](../prerequisites/oasis-node.md) process however this is done for your setup.

## Wipe State

{% hint style="warning" %}
We do not suggest that you wipe _all_ state. You might lose node identities and keys if you do it this way.
{% endhint %}

Before restarting your node you should wipe consensus state. The process for this is described in the [Wiping Node State](wiping-node-state.md#state-wipe-and-keep-node-identity) document.

## Update Configuration

If the [Upgrade Log](../upgrade-log.md) provides instructions for updating your node's configuration, update the `/serverdir/etc/config.yml` file accordingly.

## Upgrade Oasis Node

Before starting your node again, make sure you upgrade your [Oasis Node](../prerequisites/oasis-node.md) binary to the current version specified in the [Network Parameters](../../oasis-network/network-parameters.md).

## Start Your Node

This will depend on your process manager. If you don't have a process manager, you should use one. However, to start the node without a process manager you can start the [Oasis Node](../prerequisites/oasis-node.md) like so:

```bash
oasis-node --config /serverdir/etc/config.yml
```

## Clean Up

After you're comfortable with your node deployment, you can clean up the `genesis_dump.json` file.
