# Upgrade Log

## 2021-08-xx - Parameter Update

* **Upgrade height:** upgrade is scheduled to happen at epoch _**TBD**_**.**

{% hint style="info" %}
We expect the Mainnet network to reach this epoch at around _TBD_.
{% endhint %}

### Proposed Parameter Changes

The [Oasis Core 21.2.8](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/releases/tag/v21.2.8) release contains the [`consensus-params-update-2021-08` upgrade handler](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/blob/v21.2.8/go/upgrade/migrations/consensus_parameters.go) which will update the following parameters in the consensus layer:

* **`staking.params.max_allowances`** specifies the maximum number of allowances on account can store. It will be set to `16` \(default value is `0`\) to enable support for beneficiary allowances which are required to transfer tokens into a ParaTime.
* **`staking.params.gas_costs`** , **`governance.params.gas_costs`** and **`roothash.params.gas_costs`** specify gas costs for various types of staking, governance and roothash transactions. Gas costs for transactions that were missing gas costs will be added.
* **`scheduler.params.max_validators`** is the maximum size of the consensus committee \(i.e. the validator set\). It will be increased to`110` \(it was set to `100` previously\).

### Instructions - Voting

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Voting for the upgrade proposal will end on** _**TBD.**_
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
At this time only entities which have active validator nodes scheduled in the validator set are eligible to vote for governance proposals.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
At least **75%** of the **voting power** needs to cast vote on the upgrade proposal for the result to be valid.

At least **90%** of the votes need to be **yes** votes for a proposal to be accepted.
{% endhint %}

This upgrade will be the first upgrade that will use the new on-chain governance service introduced in the [Cobalt Upgrade](../mainnet/cobalt-upgrade.md).

The Oasis Protocol Foundation will submit an [upgrade governance proposal](https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-core/high-level-components/index/services/governance#submit-proposal) with the following contents:

```yaml
{
   "v": 1,
    "handler": "consensus-params-update-2021-08",
    "target": {
        "consensus_protocol": {
            "major": 4
        },
        "runtime_host_protocol": {
            "major": 3
        },
        "runtime_committee_protocol": {
            "major": 2
        }
    },
    "epoch": <TBD>
}
```

 To view the proposal yourself, you can run the following command on your online Oasis Node:

```bash
oasis-node governance list_proposals -a $ADDR | jq
```

where `$ADDR` represents the path to the internal Oasis Node UNIX socket prefixed with `unix:` \(e.g.`unix:/serverdir/node/internal.sock`\).

Obtain [your entity's nonce](../manage-tokens/oasis-cli-tools/get-account-nonce.md#get-your-entitys-nonce) and store it in the `NONCE` variable. You can do that by running:

```yaml
ENTITY_DIR=<PATH-TO-YOUR-ENTITY>
ADDRESS=$(oasis-node stake pubkey2address --public_key \
  $(cat $ENTITY_DIR/entity.json | jq .id -r))
NONCE=$(oasis-node stake account nonce --stake.account.address $ADDRESS -a $ADDR)
```

where `<PATH-TO-YOUR-ENTITY>` is the path to your entity's descriptor, e.g. `/serverdir/node/entity/`.

To vote for the proposal, use the following command to generate a suitable transaction:

```bash
oasis-node governance gen_cast_vote \
  "${TX_FLAGS[@]}" \
  --vote.proposal.id <TBD> \
  --vote yes \
  --transaction.file tx_cast_vote.json \
  --transaction.nonce $NONCE \
  --transaction.fee.gas 2000 \
  --transaction.fee.amount 2000
```

where `TX_FLAGS` refer to previously set base and signer flags as described in the [Oasis CLI Tools Setup](../manage-tokens/oasis-cli-tools/setup.md#storing-base-and-signer-flags-in-an-environment-variable) doc.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you use a Ledger-signer backed entity, you will need to install version 2.3.1 of the Oasis App as described in [Installing Oasis App 2.3.1 to Your Ledger](upgrade-log.md#installing-oasis-app-2-3-1-to-your-ledger). This is needed because the current version of the Oasis App available through Ledger Live, version 1.8.2, doesn't support signing the `governance.CastVote` transaction type.
{% endhint %}

To submit the generated transaction, copy `tx_cast_vote.json` to the online Oasis node and submit it from there:

```bash
oasis-node consensus submit_tx \
  -a $ADDR \
  --transaction.file tx_cast_vote.json
```

### Instructions - Before Upgrade System Preparation

* This upgrade will upgrade **Oasis Core** to version **21.2.8** which:
  * Upgrades the BadgerDB database backend from v2 to v3. See [**BadgerDB v2 to v3 Migration**](upgrade-log.md#badgerdb-v2-to-v3-migration) section for required steps to be done before upgrade.
  * Has a check that makes sure the **file descriptor limit** is set to an appropriately high value \(at least 50000\). While previous versions only warned in case the limit was set too low, this version will refuse to start. Follow the [File Descriptor Limit](prerequisites/system-configuration.md#file-descriptor-limit) documentation page for details on how to increase the limit on your system.
* Stop your node, replace the old version of Oasis Node with version [21.2.8](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/releases/tag/v21.2.8) and restart your node.

{% hint style="success" %}
Since Oasis Core 21.2.8 is otherwise compatible with the current consensus layer protocol, you may upgrade your Mainnet node to this version at any time.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
For this upgrade, do NOT wipe state.
{% endhint %}

* Once reaching the designated upgrade epoch, your node will stop and needs to be upgraded to Oasis Core [21.2.8](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/releases/tag/v21.2.8).
  * If you upgraded your node to Oasis Core 21.2.8 before the upgrade epoch was reached, you only need to restart your node for the upgrade to proceed.
  * Otherwise, you need to upgrade your node to Oasis Core 21.2.8 first and then restart it.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you use a process manager like [systemd](https://github.com/systemd/systemd) or [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/), you can configure it to restart the Oasis Node automatically.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The Mainnet's genesis file and the genesis document's hash will remain the same.
{% endhint %}

### BadgerDB v2 to v3 Migration

This upgrade will upgrade Oasis Core to version **21.2.x** which includes the new [**BadgerDB**](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) **v3**.

Since BadgerDB's on-disk format changed in v3, it requires on-disk state migration. The migration process is done automatically and makes the following steps:

* Upon startup, Oasis Node will start migrating all `<DATA-DIR>/**/*.badger.db` files \(Badger v2 files\) and start writing Badger v3 DB to files with the `.migrate` suffix.
* If the migration fails in the middle, Oasis Node will delete all `<DATA-DIR>/**/*.badger.db.migrate` files the next time it starts and start the migration \(of the remaining `<DATA-DIR>/**/*.badger.db`

  files\) again.

* If the migration succeeds, Oasis Node will append the `.backup` suffix to all `<DATA-DIR>/**/*.badger.db` files \(Badger v2 files\) and remove the `.migrate` suffix from all `<DATA-DIR>/**/*.badger.db.migrate` files \(Badger v3 files\).

#### Extra storage requirements

Your node will thus need to have extra storage space to store both the old and the new BadgerDB files.

To see estimate how much extra space the migration will need, use the `du` tool:

```text
shopt -s globstar
du -h <DATA-DIR>/**/*.badger.db | sort -h -r
```

This is an example output from a Mainnet node that uses `/srv/oasis/node` as the `<DATA-DIR>`:

```text
43G	/srv/oasis/node/tendermint/data/blockstore.badger.db
28G	/srv/oasis/node/tendermint/abci-state/mkvs_storage.badger.db
311M	/srv/oasis/node/tendermint/data/state.badger.db
2.0M	/srv/oasis/node/tendermint/abci-state/mkvs_storage.badger.db/checkpoints
996K	/srv/oasis/node/tendermint/abci-state/mkvs_storage.badger.db/checkpoints/4517601
996K	/srv/oasis/node/tendermint/abci-state/mkvs_storage.badger.db/checkpoints/4507601
992K	/srv/oasis/node/tendermint/abci-state/mkvs_storage.badger.db/checkpoints/4517601/ba6218d7be2df31ba6e7201a8585c6435154728e55bbb7df1ffebe683bf60217
992K	/srv/oasis/node/tendermint/abci-state/mkvs_storage.badger.db/checkpoints/4507601/1e0bf592bb0d99832b13ad91bc32aed018dfc2639e07b93a254a05f6791a19ac
984K	/srv/oasis/node/tendermint/abci-state/mkvs_storage.badger.db/checkpoints/4517601/ba6218d7be2df31ba6e7201a8585c6435154728e55bbb7df1ffebe683bf60217/chunks
984K	/srv/oasis/node/tendermint/abci-state/mkvs_storage.badger.db/checkpoints/4507601/1e0bf592bb0d99832b13ad91bc32aed018dfc2639e07b93a254a05f6791a19ac/chunks
148K	/srv/oasis/node/persistent-store.badger.db
36K	/srv/oasis/node/tendermint/data/evidence.badger.db
```

{% hint style="info" %}
After you've confirmed your node is up and running, you can safely delete all the  `<DATA-DIR>/**/*.badger.db.backup` files.
{% endhint %}

#### Extra memory requirements

BadgerDB v2 to v3 migration can use a number of Go routines to migrate different database files in parallel.

However, this comes with a memory cost. For larger database files, it might need up to 4 GB of RAM per database, so we recommend lowering the number of Go routines BadgerDB uses during migration \(`badger.migrate.num_go_routines`\) if your node has less than 8 GB of RAM.

If your node has less than 8 GB of RAM, set the number of Go routines BadgerDB uses during migration to 2 \(default is 8\) by adding the following to your node's `config.yml`:

```text
# BadgerDB configuration.
badger:
  migrate:
    # Set the number of Go routines BadgerDB uses during migration to 2 to lower
    # the memory pressure during migration (at the expense of a longer migration
    # time).
    num_go_routines: 2
```

### Installing Oasis App 2.3.1 to Your Ledger

{% hint style="info" %}
This manual installation procedure is needed until the latest version of the Oasis App, version 2.3.1, becomes available through [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/)'s Manager.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Unlike Nano S devices, **Nano X** devices are locked meaning one cannot manual install the latest version of the Oasis App on them. If you use a Nano X device, you will need to temporarily switch to a Nano S device or wait for the new version of the Oasis App to be available through Ledger Live's Manager.
{% endhint %}

#### Update Firmware to Version 2.0.0

First, make sure the firmware on your Nano S is up-to-date. At least [version 2.0.0](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010446000-Ledger-Nano-S-firmware-release-notes) released on May 4, 2021, is required. Follow [Ledger's instructions for updating the firmware on your Nano S](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113-Update-Ledger-Nano-S-firmware).

#### Install Prerequisites for Manual Installation

The manual installation process relies on some tooling that needs to be available on the system:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.
* [Python tools for Ledger Blue, Nano S and Nano X](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-loader-python).

Most systems should already have [Python](https://www.python.org/) pre-installed.

To install [Python tools for Ledger Blue, Nano S and Nano X](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-loader-python), use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```text
pip3 install --upgrade ledgerblue
```

You might want to install the packages to a [Python virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments) or via so-called [User install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs) \(i.e. isolated to the current user\).

#### Download Oasis App 2.3.1

Download the [Oasis App 2.3.1 installer for Nano S](https://github.com/Zondax/ledger-oasis/releases/download/v2.3.1/installer_s.sh) from [Zondax's Oasis App GitHub repo](https://github.com/Zondax/ledger-oasis).

#### Install Oasis App 2.3.1

Make the downloaded installer executable by running:

```yaml
chmod +x installer_s.sh
```

Connect you Nano S and unlock it. Then execute the installer:

```yaml
./installer_s.sh load
```

Your Nano S will give you the option to either:

* _Deny unsafe manager_, or
* review the _Public Key_ and _Allow unsafe manager_.

First review the public key and ensure it matches the `Generated random root public key` displayed in the terminal.

Then double press the _Allow unsafe manager_ option.

{% hint style="info" %}
If there is an existing version of the _Oasis App_ installed on your Nano S, you will be prompted with the _Uninstall Oasis_ screen, followed by reviewing the _Identifier_ and finally confirming deletion on the _Confirm action_ screen.
{% endhint %}

After the new version of the Oasis App has finished loading, you will be prompted with the _Install app Oasis_ screen, followed by reviewing the _Version_, _Identifier_ and _Code Identifier_ screens_._ Ensure the values are as follows:

* Version: 2.3.1
* Identifier: `E0CB424D3B1C2A0F694BCB6E99C3B37C7685399D59DD12D7CF80AF4A487882B1`
* Code Identifier: `C17EBE7CD356D01411A02A81C64CDA3E81F193BDA09BEBBD0AEAF75AD7EC35E3`

Finally, confirm installation of the new app by double pressing on the _Perform installation_ screen. Your Ledger device will ask for your PIN again.

#### Verify Installation

Open the Oasis App on your Nano S and ensure the _Version_ screen shows version 2.3.1.

{% hint style="info" %}
Starting the manually installed version of the Oasis App will always show the _This app is not genuine_ screen, followed by _Identifier_ \(which should match the Identifier value above\) screen. Finally, open the application by double pressing on the _Open application_ screen.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
After you've signed your `governance.CastVote` transaction, you can safely downgrade Oasis App to the latest official version available via [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/), version 1.8.2.

To do that, just open Ledger Live's Manager and it will prompt you to install version 1.8.2.
{% endhint %}

## 2021-04-28 \(16:00 UTC\) - Cobalt Upgrade

* **Upgrade height:** upgrade is scheduled to happen at epoch **5046.**

{% hint style="info" %}
We expect the Mainnet network to reach this epoch at around 2021-04-28 12:00 UTC.
{% endhint %}

### Instructions - Before upgrade

* Make sure you are running the latest Mainnet-compatible Oasis Node version: [20.12.7](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/releases/tag/v20.12.7).
  * If you are running a different **20.12.x** Oasis Node version, update to version **20.12.7** before the upgrade.

{% hint style="success" %}
Version **20.12.7** is backwards compatible with other **20.12.x** releases, so upgrade can be performed at any time by stopping the node and replacing the binary.
{% endhint %}

* To ensure your node will stop at epoch **5046** [submit the following upgrade descriptor](maintenance-guides/handling-network-upgrades.md#stop-the-node-at-specific-epoch) at any time before the upgrade: 

  ```text
  {
    "name": "mainnet-upgrade-2021-04-28",
    "method": "internal",
    "identifier": "mainnet-upgrade-2021-04-28",
    "epoch": 5046
  }
  ```

{% hint style="warning" %}
The upgrade descriptor contains a non-existing upgrade handler and will be used to coordinate the network shutdown, the rest of the upgrade is manual.
{% endhint %}

#### **Runtime operators**

Following section is relevant only for **runtime operators** that are running **storage** nodes for active runtimes on the Mainnet.

This upgrade requires a runtime storage node migration to be performed **before the upgrade genesis is published**. This can be done before the upgrade epoch is reached by stopping all runtime nodes and running the migration.

**Backup your node's data directory**

To prevent irrecoverable runtime storage data corruption/loss in case of a failed storage migration, backup your node's data directory.

For example, to backup the `/serverdir/node` directory using the [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) tool, run:

```text
rsync -a /serverdir/node/ /serverdir/node-BACKUP/
```

The storage database on all storage nodes needs to be migrated with the following command \(using the [21.1.1](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/releases/tag/v21.1.1) binary\):

```text
oasis-node storage migrate \
  --datadir <NODE-DATADIR> \
  --runtime.supported <RUNTIME-ID>
```

After the migration to v5 completes, you will see an output similar to:

```text
...
- migrating from v4 to v5...
- migrating version 24468...
- migrated root state-root:195cf7a9a103e7300b2bb4e537cb9935cbebd83e448e67aa55433861a6ad7426 -> state-root:cea105a5d701deab935b94af9e8e0c5af5dcdb61c242bf434da9f11aa8d110ba
- migrated root io-root:0850c5a33ee7f45aa92724b7d5f28c9ac9ae8799b88cc5be9773e8aba9526ca7 -> io-root:19713a2b44e1bf868ebee43c36872baa3058870bb890a5e25d1c4cea2622be77
- migrated root io-root:477391131f60ac2c22bce9167c7e3783a13d4fb81fddd2d388b4ead6a586fe52 -> io-root:f29f86d491303c5fd7b3572e97cbd65b7487b6b4ac519623afd161cc2e4678b7
```

Take note of the displayed `state-root` and report it to the Foundation, as it needs to be included in the upgrade's new genesis file. Keep the runtime nodes stopped until the upgrade epoch is reached. At upgrade epoch, upgrade the nodes by following the remaining steps above.

### Instructions - Upgrade day

Following steps should be performed on **2021-04-28** only after the network has reached the upgrade epoch and has halted:

* Download the genesis file published in the [Cobalt Upgrade release](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/mainnet-artifacts/releases/tag/2021-04-28).

{% hint style="info" %}
Mainnet state at epoch **5046** will be exported and migrated to a 21.1.x compatible genesis file. Upgrade genesis file will be published on the above link soon after reaching the upgrade epoch.
{% endhint %}

* Verify the provided Cobalt upgrade genesis file by comparing it to network state dump. See instructions in the [Handling Network Upgrades](maintenance-guides/handling-network-upgrades.md#download-and-verify-the-provided-genesis-file) guide.
* Replace the old genesis file with the new Cobalt upgrade genesis file.
* Stop your node \(if you haven't stopped it already by submitting the upgrade descriptor\).
* Replace the old version of Oasis Node with version [21.1.1](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/releases/tag/v21.1.1).
* [Wipe state](maintenance-guides/wiping-node-state.md#state-wipe-and-keep-node-identity).
* Start your node.

{% hint style="info" %}
For more detailed instructions, see the [Handling Network Upgrades](maintenance-guides/handling-network-upgrades.md) guide.
{% endhint %}

### Additional notes

Examine the [Change Log](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/blob/v21.1.1/CHANGELOG.md) of the 21.1.1 \(and 21.0\) releases.

**Runtime operators**

Note the following configuration change in the [21.0](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/blob/v21.1.1/CHANGELOG.md#configuration-changes) release.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Storage access policy changes**

Due to the changes in the default access policy on storage nodes, at least one of the storage nodes should be configured with the`worker.storage.public_rpc.enabled` flag set to `true`.

Otherwise, external runtime clients wont be able to connect to any storage nodes.
{% endhint %}

## 2020-11-18 \(16:00 UTC\) - Mainnet

* **Block height** when Mainnet Beta network stops: **702000.**

{% hint style="info" %}
We expect the Mainnet Beta network to reach this block height at around 2020-11-18 13:30 UTC.
{% endhint %}

* **Upgrade window:**
  * Start: **2020-11-18T16:00:00Z.**
  * End: After nodes representing **2/3+ stake** do the upgrade.

### Instructions

* Download [Oasis Node](prerequisites/oasis-node.md) version [20.12.2](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/releases/tag/v20.12.2), while continuing to run version 20.10.x.
* \(optional\) Use Oasis Node version 20.12.2 to dump network state at the specified block height. It will connect to the running version 20.10.x node.
* Download the Mainnet genesis file published in the [2020-11-18 release](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/mainnet-artifacts/releases/tag/2020-11-18).
* \(optional\) Verify the provided Mainnet genesis file by comparing it to network state dump. See instructions in the [Handling Network Upgrades](maintenance-guides/handling-network-upgrades.md#download-and-verify-the-provided-genesis-file) guide.
* Replace the old Mainnet Beta genesis file with the Mainnet genesis file.
* Stop your node.
* Remove the old 20.10.x version of Oasis Node.
* [Wipe state](maintenance-guides/wiping-node-state.md#state-wipe-and-keep-node-identity).
* Update your node's configuration per instructions in [Configuration changes](upgrade-log.md#configuration-changes) below.
* Start your node.

{% hint style="info" %}
This time, we recommend dumping the network state with the upgraded Oasis Node binary so that the genesis file will be in the [canonical form](https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-core/high-level-components/index/genesis#canonical-form).

The canonical form will make it easier to compare the obtained genesis file with the one provided by us.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For more detailed instructions, see the [Handling Network Upgrades](maintenance-guides/handling-network-upgrades.md) guide.
{% endhint %}

### Configuration changes

Since we are upgrading to the Mainnet, we recommend you change your node's configuration and disable pruning of the consensus' state by removing the `consensus.tendermint.abci.prune` key.

For example, this configuration:

```yaml
...

# Consensus backend.
consensus:
  # Setting this to true will mean that the node you're deploying will attempt
  # to register as a validator.
  validator: true

  # Tendermint backend configuration.
  tendermint:
    abci:
      prune:
        strategy: keep_n
        # Keep ~7 days of data since block production is ~1 block every 6 seconds.
        # (7*24*3600/6 = 100800)
        num_kept: 100800
    core:
      listen_address: tcp://0.0.0.0:26656

    ...
```

Becomes:

```yaml
...

# Consensus backend.
consensus:
  # Setting this to true will mean that the node you're deploying will attempt
  # to register as a validator.
  validator: true

  # Tendermint backend configuration.
  tendermint:
    core:
      listen_address: tcp://0.0.0.0:26656

    ...
```
