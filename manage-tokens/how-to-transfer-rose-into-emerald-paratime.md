# How to Transfer ROSE into Emerald ParaTime

## About

[Emerald](../developer-resources/emerald-paratime.md) is an EVM-compatible blockchain running inside the Oasis ParaTime. Because the balance of your ROSE wallet is stored on the consensus layer - outside of ParaTime's reach - there is a special mechanism for Emerald to access your tokens. Namely, the _Deposit_ action will create the allowance policy for the provided ParaTime to access the specific amount of your ROSE and to be used by the provided Ethereum-compatible wallet. The _Withdrawal_ action in contrast transfers ROSE back from the ParaTime to your wallet on the consensus layer and removes the allowance.

Currently, only the Oasis Wallet Browser Extension supports a graphical user interface to perform deposit and withdrawal actions.

## Managing your Emerald account with Oasis Wallet Browser Extension

Firstly, install the Oasis Wallet Browser extension, restore your existing or create a new Oasis wallet as described in the [Oasis Wallet Browser Extension chapter](oasis-wallets/browser-extension.md#create-a-new-wallet).

![Oasis Wallet Extension - chrome web store](<../.gitbook/assets/Adding Extension>)



Once done, you will see your balance on the **Oasis consensus layer**. Next, we will import your Ethereum wallet to be used in Emerald.

### Importing Ethereum wallet account

In the top-right corner, click your account icon to open the Account management menu.

![Account Management - Importing Accounts](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-01-12 at 18.00.26.png>)

Click "Import" and select "Ethereum-compatible Private Key" to import your existing Ethereum Account address.

{% hint style="info" %}
We assume that you already have your Ethereum keypair. If you donâ€™t have one yet, please go and create one. Store your Private Key, because you will need it in the Oasis Wallet Browser Extension.
{% endhint %}

![Importing Ethereum-compatible Account with Private Key](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6LGsO6X02pPFmFrTPHhqpim83dg9cDjXfFMmkjcV5zKYdNNbn\_FLZ4iqJ4izsQ89esPZhOJ8ZgMTaQf9VkhkZ\_ZH6oc8yQOzFz3TGiVjStqnNdg-0YcIOy17TfZ5MvJGemlhx1tM)

Fill in the "Account name" that will appear later in the Account Management screen.

Next, paste your hex-encoded Ethereum private key.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You will need to import **the** **private key and** **not the mnemonics**. You can derive a private key from the mnemonics with BIP39->BIP44 converter. For example by using the [Ian Cole's tool](https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39/releases) offline.
{% endhint %}

Your newly imported Ethereum account will appear under the "Ethereum-compatible Account" section in the Account Management screen. Check that the Ethereum address shown at the bottom matches the address that was shown to you when you generated the Ethereum key.

{% hint style="danger" %}
In older versions of the Oasis Wallet Browser Extension there was also a bech32-encoded version of the Ethereum address shown in the Ethereum-compatible wallet. This address is only used internally for setting the allowance policy on the Oasis network. **If you encounter this, you should immediately update your Wallet Extension! The bech32-encoded address of the Ethereum-compatible account must never be used for transferring ROSE to. The signature schemes are incompatible (ECDSA versus ed25519) and those tokens would not be accessible anymore!**

### Depositing ROSE To Emerald ParaTime

Now, you can transfer your ROSE to Emerald ParaTime. Navigate to the "ParaTimes" tab. Notice two ParaTimes: Emerald and Cipher with the corresponding ParaTime IDs. Under Emerald click on the "To ParaTime" button.

****

Fill in the the "Amount" of ROSE that you want to transfer to Emerald ParaTime and your **Ethereum-compatible address** in **** the "To" field you imported/created before. Then, click "Next", review and confirm the transaction.

{% hint style="info" %}
At the time of writing, depositing and withdrawing ROSE to and from ParaTimes works for Oasis wallets **imported from the private key or the mnemonic only**. Support for the Ledger hardware wallet is not implemented yet.
{% endhint %}

### Verifying ROSE balance on Emerald ParaTime

If everything went well, your entered amount of ROSE was sent to the Ethereum-compatible address in Emerald. Let's verify that your ROSE safely arrived on your Emerald Ethereum wallet.

#### Wallet Browser Extension

You can check the balance in the Oasis Wallet extension by opening the "Account Management" tab and selecting your Ethereum-compatible account which you used to send ROSE to. Then click on the back arrow and navigate to the "ParaTimes" tab. Under Emerald you will notice the available amount of your ROSE.

![ROSE balance in Emerald](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-12-23 at 18.16.48.png>)

#### Metamask (or Brave browser built-in wallet)

You can verify your balance in [Metamask](https://metamask.io). First, install the extension in your favorite browser and add the Emerald Network (refer to the Web3 gateway parameters [here](https://docs.oasis.dev/general/developer-resources/emerald-paratime#web3-gateway) for either Emerald Mainnet or Testnet). Then, import your Ethereum keypair and your balance should immediately be visible.

Brave wallet network configuration requires you to enter Chain's currency decimals for ROSE: 18)

### Withdrawing ROSE from Emerald ParaTime

You can withdraw your ROSE from Emerald back to your Oasis wallet by first selecting your Ethereum-compatible account in the Account Management screen. Next, switch to ParaTimes tab and click on the "To Consensus" button near the Emerald entry. Fill in the "Amount" and your bech32-encoded Oasis wallet address and confirm the withdrawal. In a few moments you will have your ROSE accessible on the consensus layer.
