# File-Based Signer

{% hint style="danger" %}
We strongly suggest that you do not use any entity/staking account that is generated with the file-based signer on the Mainnet.\
\
In case you need to use the file-based signer, make sure you only use it on an [offline/air-gapped machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air\_gap\_\(networking\)). Gaining access to your entity's/staking account's private key can compromise your tokens.
{% endhint %}

You can hold your ROSE tokens via a private key stored in a file.

This option is only supported via our Oasis Node CLI tool. To set it up, follow the Oasis Node documentation:
