## How to use the Oasis Wallet - Web

### **Access the Oasis Wallet via your web browser**

You can access the [Oasis Wallet - Web](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-wallet-web/) by heading to [https://wallet.oasisprotocol.org](https://wallet.oasisprotocol.org). For the best performance, we recommend using [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or any other [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home)-based browser.

### **Create a new wallet**

If you do not currently have an existing Oasis wallet address, you can create a new wallet address directly from the Oasis Wallet's home screen. Click on the “Create wallet” button.

The next page contains information about your mnemonic (an ordered list of words representing your keyphrase), which you will need in order to retrieve your wallet later. Review the information on this page very carefully. Save your mnemonic in the right order in a secure location.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your mnemonic (i.e. keyphrase) is required to access your wallet. Be sure to store it in a secure location. If you lose or forget your mnemonic, you will lose access to your wallet and any token funds contained in it.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Never share your mnemonic (i.e. keyphrase). Anyone with your mnemonic can access your wallet and your tokens.
{% endhint %}

After you’ve saved your mnemonic, click the “I saved my keyphrase” checkbox and then click on the “Open my wallet” button.

Next, you will need to confirm your mnemonic by filling in some missing words. You can enter the missing word for each respective box, by clicking on the appropriate word from the list of words presented below. Be sure to enter all of the missing words in the right order.

After you correctly enter all of the missing words, you will be taken to your Oasis Wallet home screen, containing information about your account balance and more.** **

### **Access an existing wallet**

If you already have an existing Oasis wallet address, you can open it in the web wallet by clicking the “Open wallet” button on the home screen.&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/04 - Access an existing wallet.png>)

Next, you should select whether you want to open your wallet via a mnemonic, a private key, or a Ledger hardware wallet. Select the respective button corresponding to the retrieval method you want to use.\
\
To open your wallet via a mnemonic or a private key, make sure you have that information readily available. To open your wallet via a Ledger hardware wallet, make sure you have your Ledger device readily available and have familiarized yourself with the [Oasis-specific Ledger usage instructions](../holding-rose-tokens/ledger-wallet.md).&#x20;

Follow the instructions on the screens that follow to open your existing wallet address.

After you complete the instructions, you will be taken to your Oasis Wallet home screen, containing information about your account balance and more.&#x20;
