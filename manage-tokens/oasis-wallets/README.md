# Oasis Wallets

## **What are the official Oasis Wallets?**

The [Oasis Foundation](https://oasisprotocol.org) supports two first-party non-custodial wallets, a [web wallet](https://wallet.oasisprotocol.org) named [Oasis Wallet -Web](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-wallet-web/) and a browser extension wallet named Oasis Wallet - Browser Extension. Both seamlessly connect to the [Oasis Network](../../oasis-network/overview.md) and makes it easy to hold, send, and receive ROSE tokens.&#x20;

These products are fully open source, built from the ground up by Oasis community developers, with funding from the Oasis Foundationâ€™s [ROSE Bloom Grants Program](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/community/discussions/13). Both have also gone through multiple internal audits from the Oasis Foundation and [Oasis Labs](https://oasislabs.com) teams and are currently going through an external audit as well.
