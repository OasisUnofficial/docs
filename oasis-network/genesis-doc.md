# Genesis Document

## What is a Genesis Document?

A genesis document contains a set of parameters that outline the initial state of an Oasis network.

The state defined in the network's genesis document contains all the necessary information for launching that particular network \(i.e. Mainnet, [Testnet](../foundation/testnet.md)\), including initial token allocations, network parameters, and more.

{% hint style="info" %}
For a more in-depth explanation of the genesis document, see the [Genesis Document](https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-core/high-level-components/index/genesis) part of Oasis Core's developer documentation.
{% endhint %}

The important thing to note is that the genesis document is used to compute the [genesis document's hash](https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-core/high-level-components/index/genesis#genesis-documents-hash). This hash is used to verify for which network a given transaction is intended for.

### Genesis File vs. Genesis Document

A genesis file is a JSON file corresponding to a serialized genesis document. As such, it is more convenient for distribution and sharing.

When Oasis Node loads a genesis file, it converts it to a genesis document.

{% hint style="info" %}
Up to date information about the current genesis file and the current genesis document's hash can be found on the [Network Parameters](network-parameters.md) page.
{% endhint %}

## Parameters

This sections explains some of the key parameters of the genesis document.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The concrete parameter values in the following sections pertain to the Mainnet. Other Oasis networks \(e.g. [Testnet](../foundation/testnet.md)\) might use different values.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
The token balances in a genesis document \(or a genesis file\) are enumerated in base units.

The **`staking.token_value_exponent`** parameter defines the token value's base-10 exponent. For the Mainnet it is set to 9 which means 1 ROSE equals 10^9 \(i.e. billion\) base units.
{% endhint %}

### Height, Genesis Time and Chain ID

The **`height`** parameter specifies the network's initial block height. For the [Mainnet genesis file](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/mainnet-artifacts/releases/download/2020-11-18/genesis.json), it is set to 702000 indicating that Mainnet should start counting blocks from number 702000.

The **`genesis_time`** parameter is an ISO8601 UTC timestamp that specifies when the network is officially going to launch. At the time of genesis, validators are expected to come online and start participating in the consensus process for operating the network. The network starts once validators representing more than 2/3 of stake in the initial consensus committee are online.

The **`chain_id`** is a human-readable version identifier for a network.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is important to note that this value alone doesn't dictate the version of an Oasis network. Rather, the hash of the whole genesis document, i.e. the [genesis document's hash](https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-core/high-level-components/index/genesis#genesis-documents-hash), is the network's unique identifier.
{% endhint %}

### Epoch Time

The **`epochtime.params.interval`** specifies the number of blocks in an _epoch_. Epochs are used as a measure of time for the staking reward schedule, debonding intervals, network expiration period, and more. This value is set to 600, indicating that a new epoch transpires each time 600 new blocks are generated.

### Node Operator Registry

Within the **`registry`** object, there are a broad range of parameters that specify the initial set of node operators and their corresponding initial node statuses.

* **`registry.params.max_node_expiration`** The maximum duration \(in epochs\) that node registrations last. The starting value is set to 2 in order to ensure that a node is continuously online, since the node’s registration would expire each time 2 epochs pass, requiring the node to re-register.
* **`registry.entities`** The entity registrations for initial node operators, including public key and signature information.
* **`registry.nodes`** The node registrations for initial node operators, including public key and signature information.

{% hint style="info" %}
For a new network, the entity and node registrations are obtained via the entity package collection process \(e.g. [Mainnet Network Entities](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/mainnet-entities)\).

For an upgrade to an existing network, the network's state dump tool captures the network's current entity and node registrations.
{% endhint %}

### Gas Costs

The following parameters define the gas costs for various types of transactions on the network:

* **`staking.params.gas_costs.add_escrow`** The cost for an add escrow \(i.e. stake tokens\) transaction. The value is set to 1000.
* **`staking.params.gas_costs.burn`** The cost for a burn \(i.e. destroy tokens\) transaction. The value is set to 1000.
* **`staking.params.gas_costs.reclaim_escrow`** The cost for a reclaim escrow transaction \(i.e. unstake tokens\). The value is set to 1000.
* **`staking.params.gas_costs.transfer`** The cost for a transfer transaction. The value is set to 1000.
* **`staking.params.gas_costs.amend_commission_schedule`** The cost for amending, or changing, a commission schedule. The value is set to 1000.
* **`registry.params.gas_costs.deregister_entity`** The cost for a deregister entity transaction. The value is set to 1000.
* **`registry.params.gas_costs.register_entity`** The cost for a register entity transaction. The value is set to 1000.
* **`registry.params.gas_costs.register_node`** The cost for a register node transaction. The value is set to 1000.
* **`registry.params.gas_costs.register_runtime`** The cost for a register ParaTime transaction. The value is set to 1000.
* **`registry.params.gas_costs.runtime_epoch_maintenance`** The cost of a maintenance fee that a node that is registered for a ParaTime pays each epoch. The value is set to 1000.
* **`registry.params.gas_costs.unfreeze_node`** The cost for unfreeze node \(i.e. after the node is slashed and frozen\) transaction. The current value is 1000.
* **`registry.params.gas_costs.update_keymanager`** The cost for update keymanager transaction. The current value is 1000.
* **`roothash.params.gas_costs.compute_commit`** The cost for a ParaTime compute commit. The value is set to 10000.
* **`roothash.params.gas_costs.merge_commit`** The cost for a ParaTime merge commit. For the Mainnet. The value is set to 10000.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In addition to the gas costs specified above, each transaction also incurs a cost proportional to its size.

The **`consensus.params.gas_costs.tx_byte`** parameter specifies the additional gas cost for each byte of a transaction. The value is set to 1.

For example, a staking transfer transaction of size 230 bytes would have a total gas cost of 1000 + 230.
{% endhint %}

### Node & ParaTime Token Thresholds

There are several **`staking.params.thresholds`** parameters that specify the minimum number of tokens that need to be staked in order for a particular entity or a particular type of node to participate in the network.

The **`entity`,** **`node-compute`, `node-keymanager`, `node-storage`,** and **`node-validator`** parameters are set to 100,000,000,000 base units for each, indicating that you need to stake at least 100 ROSE tokens in order to have your entity or any of the specified nodes go live on the network.

The **`staking.params.thresholds`** parameters also specify the minimum thresholds for registering new ParaTimes. The **`runtime-compute`** and **`runtime-keymanager`** parameters are set to 50,000,000,000,000 base units, indicating that you need to stake at least 50,000 ROSE tokens in order to register a compute/key manager ParaTime.

### Staking & Rewards

These key parameters are related to staking and rewards on the network:

* **`staking.params.debonding_interval`** The period of time \(in epochs\) that must pass before staked or delegated tokens that are requested to be withdrawn are returned to the account's general balance. The value is set to 336 epochs, which is expected to be approximately 14 days.
* **`staking.params.min_delegation`** The minimum amount of tokens one can delegate. The value is set to 100,000,000,000 base units, or 100 ROSE tokens.
* **`staking.params.reward_schedule`** The staking reward schedule, indicating how the staking reward rate changes over time, defined at an epoch-by-epoch granular basis. The reward schedule uses a tapering formula with higher rewards being paid out at earlier epochs and then gradually decreasing over time. For more details, see the [Staking Incentives](https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-network-primer/token-metrics-and-distribution#staking-incentives) doc.
* **`staking.params.signing_reward_threshold_numerator`** and **`staking.params.signing_reward_threshold_denominator`** These parameters define the proportion of blocks that a validator must sign during each epoch to receive staking rewards. The set fraction of 3/4 means that a validator must maintain an uptime of at least 75% blocks during an epoch in order to receive staking rewards for that period.
* **`staking.params.fee_split_weight_propose`** The block proposer's share of transaction fees. The value is set to 2.
* **`staking.params.fee_split_weight_next_propose`** The next block proposer's share of transaction fees. The value is set to 1.
* **`staking.params.fee_split_weight_vote`** The block signer’s/voter’s share of transaction fees. The value is set to 1.
* **`staking.params.reward_factor_epoch_signed`** The factor for rewards distributed to validators who signed at least threshold blocks in a given epoch. The value is set to 1.
* **`staking.params.reward_factor_block_proposed`** The factor for rewards earned for block proposal. The value is set to 0, indicating validators get no extra staking rewards for proposing a block.

### Commission Schedule

The following parameters control how commission rates and bounds can be defined and changed:

* **`staking.params.commision_schedule_rules.rate_change_interval`** The time interval \(in epochs\) at which rate changes can be specified in a commission schedule. The value is set to 1 indicating that the commission rate can change on every epoch.
* **`staking.params.commision_schedule_rules.rate_bound_lead`** The minimum lead time \(in epochs\) needed for changes to commission rate bounds. This is set to protect the delegators from unexpected changes in an operator's commission rates. The value is set to 336, which is expected to be approximately 14 days.
* **`staking.params.commision_schedule_rules.max_rate_steps`** The maximum number of rate step changes in a commission schedule.The value is set to 10, indicating that the commission schedule can have a maximum of 10 rate steps.
* **`staking.params.commision_schedule_rules.max_bound_steps`** The maximum number of commission rate bound step changes in the commission schedule. The value is set to 10, indicating that the commission schedule can have a maximum of 10 rate bound steps.

### Token Supply & Ledger

The following parameters specify the total token supply, total token pool reserved for staking rewards, and account balances across the network at the time of genesis:

* **`staking.total_supply`** The total token supply for the network. This is fixed at 10 billion ROSE tokens \(the value is set to 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 base units\).
* **`staking.common_pool`** The tokens reserved for staking rewards to be paid out over time.
* **`staking.ledger`** The staking ledger, encoding all accounts and corresponding account balances on the network at the time of genesis, including accounts for initial operators, backers, custodial wallets, etc.
* **`staking.delegations`** The encoding of the initial delegations at the time of genesis.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Interpreting your account balance in the `staking.ledger`**

Your account's **`general.balance`** includes all of your tokens that have not been staked or delegated. Within your account's **`escrow`**field, the **`active.balance`** holds the total amount of tokens are \(actively\) delegated to you.
{% endhint %}

### Slashing

These parameters specify key values for the network's slashing mechanism:

* **`staking.params.slashing.0.amount`** The amount of tokens to slash for double signing. The value is set to 100,000,000,000 base units, or 100 ROSE tokens.
* **`staking.params.slashing.0.freeze_interval`** The duration \(in epochs\) for which a node that has been slashed for double signing is “frozen,” or barred from participating in the network's consensus committee. The value of 18446744073709551615 \(the maximum value for a 64-bit unsigned integer\) means that any node slashed for double signing is, in effect, permanently banned from the network.

### Consensus

The following parameters are used to define key values for the network's consensus protocol:

* **`consensus.backend`** Defines the backend consensus protocol. The value is set to "tendermint" indicating that the [Tendermint Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) BFT protocol is used.
* **`scheduler.params.min_validators`** The minimum size for the consensus committee. The value is set to 15 validators.
* **`scheduler.params.max_validators`** The maximum size for the consensus committee. The value is set to 100 validators.
* **`scheduler.params.max_validators_per_entity`** The maximum number of nodes from a given entity that can be in the consensus committee at any time. The value is set to 1.
* **`consensus.params.timeout_commit`** Specifies how long to wait \(in nanoseconds\) after committing a block before starting a new block height \(this affects the block interval\). The value is set to to 5,000,000,000 nanoseconds, or 5 seconds.
* **`consensus.params.max_tx_size`** Maximum size \(in bytes\) for consensus-layer transactions. The value is set to 32,768 bytes, or 32 kB.
* **`consensus.params.max_block_size`** Maximum block size \(in bytes\). The value is set to 22,020,096 bytes, or 22 MB.
* **`consensus.params.max_block_gas`** Maximum block gas. The value is set to 0, which specifies an unlimited amount of gas.
* **`consensus.params.public_key_blacklist`** A list of the public keys that cannot be used on the network. Currently, there are no blacklisted public keys.

### Halt Epoch

The **`halt_epoch`** parameter specifies the epoch when the network is scheduled to halt. This parameter is set to intentionally force an upgrade before this epoch is reached. For the [Mainnet genesis file](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/mainnet-artifacts/releases/download/2020-11-18/genesis.json), it is set to 9940 indicating that Mainnet should be upgraded before epoch 9940.
