# Community Hub

## üéâ Welcome to the Oasis Community

Whether you're a blockchain enthusiast, a software developer, or someone who is just starting learn about crypto, we're excited to welcome you to our community.

We're very excited to welcome individuals who come from many different backgrounds and who bring to our community a wide range of perspectives, experiences, and skillsets. There are many ways you can contribute to helping Oasis Network grow by leveraging your unique abilities and passions.

### Join the Oasis Ambassador Program

### Apply for a ROSE Bloom Grant

## üè¶ ROSE Token Distribution Process

Please note that any tokens you earn or win through community programs, such as the Community Cup program  or the Ambassador Rewards program, are not sent to you immediately. You need to complete the KYC process and submit your ROSE wallet address before the Oasis Foundation can send you any ROSE tokens.   
  
This token distribution process can take several weeks from start to finish. To learn more about each step in the process and how long you can expect to wait before you receive your ROSE tokens, please see the [Token Delivery & KYC Guide](token-delivery-and-kyc.md).

## üì≤ Setting Up Your ROSE Wallet

In order to receive your ROSE tokens from the Oasis Foundation for any work you have contributed to the network, you need to set up a ROSE wallet.   
  
We have a wide variety of wallet solutions available:

* If you have a Ledger device, you can use one of our [Ledger-backed web wallets](../manage-tokens/web-wallets.md#ledger-backed-web-wallets). 
* If you want an easy-to-use, beginner friendly wallet, you can use the [Bitpie wallet](../manage-tokens/mobile-wallets/) available on mobile devices. 

## üí∞ Delegate Your ROSE Tokens & Earn Staking Rewards

Did you know you grow your ROSE holdings over time, while also contributing to the security of the Oasis Network? The Oasis Network relies on a process called staking in order to ensure the network is protected against attacks. There are mechanisms built into the Oasis Network that pay out rewards to validator nodes that have staked ROSE tokens to secure the network.  
  
Anyone who has ROSE tokens can delegate their tokens to a validator and start earning a slice of that validator's staking rewards, based on how many ROSE tokens are delegated.   
  
You can use the following wallets to delegate your ROSE tokens to validators:

* If you have a Ledger device , you can use the [Chorus One Anthem](https://anthem.chorus.one/) wallet.
* If you prefer to use a simple, beginner friendly wallet, you can use the [Bitpie](https://bitpie.com/) mobile wallet. 

You can review the list of active Oasis Network validators via the [Oasis Scan](https://www.oasisscan.com/validators) web tool. You're welcome to delegate your ROSE tokens to any of the active validators.   
  
As you're deciding which validator to delegate to, keep in mind the following information for each validator:

* Current status of the node
* Uptime percentage of the node
* Number of delegators currently delegating to that validator
* Commission rate \(the cut of your rewards that the validator claims in exchange for running the node and providing the staking service to you\)

You can learn more about each validator by clicking on their name and going to their validator info page.
