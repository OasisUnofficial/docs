# The Testnet

{% hint style="danger" %}
**The Testnet may be subject to frequent version upgrades and state resets.**

{% hint style="info" %}
On the Testnet, TEST tokens are in use -- if you need some to test your clients, nodes or paratimes, feel free to request them on [**\#testnet** in the Community Slack](../community-resources/connect-with-us.md). Note that these are test-only tokens and account balances, as any other state, may be frequently reset.
