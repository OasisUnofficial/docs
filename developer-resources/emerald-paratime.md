# Emerald ParaTime

The Emerald ParaTime is our official EVM Compatible ParaTime providing smart contract environment with full EVM compatibility.

As the official EVM compatible ParaTime on the Oasis Network, Emerald allows for:

* Full EVM compatibility
* Easy integration with EVM-based DApps, such as DeFi, NFT, Metaverse and crypto gaming
* Scalability — increased throughput of transactions
* Low-cost — 99%+ lower fees than Ethereum
* Cross-chain bridge to enable cross-chain interoperability (upcoming)

## ParaTime Incentives <a href="#1b5b" id="1b5b"></a>

Emerald is fully decentralized with node operators distributed globally, and Oasis ROSE will be the native token used for gas fees.

The ParaTime will release tokens on-chain to reward nodes for participation. These tokens will be released, per epoch, with the reward being 3 ROSE Tokens per entity per epoch.

Epochs are currently being produced at a speed of one per hour. Each node has an approximately 30% chance of being selected by the primary committee to claim the rewards. Hence, a node entity can earn 24 ROSE tokens per day, 720 ROSE tokens per month.

The reward program is two years long.
